# Block spans

this is a paragraph.

this is a long paragraph with *italics* and **bold** items.

this is a long paragraph where *an italicized section ends with a space *.

this is a *long paragraph that spans 
two* lines.

this is a paragraph with *a span that is very very very very very very very very
very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very
very very very very very very very* long. 

this is a paragraph where _italics_ and __bold__ are set with underscores.

# italics *in* titles

yes, we can.

# bold **in** titles

inline `code` in this paragraph. this is a ``test for this`` stuff.

superscripts ^are kinda^ cool. subscripts can ~also~ be kinda lame. there's also sections
with ~~striked out~~ text.

a new line can be outputted for lines with a couple  
of spaces.
